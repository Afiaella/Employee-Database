# Employee Database

## Background

In this project, I designed tables to hold data in CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, you performed **data modeling**, **data engineering**, and **data analysis**.


#### Data Modeling

I inspected the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables. 

#### Data Engineering

* I usde the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Remembering to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

  * For the primary keys, I verified that the column is unique. 

* I imported each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table. 

#### Data Analysis

Once you have I completed database, I performed these steps:

1. Listed the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.

2. Listed first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.

3. Listed the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.

4. Listed the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. Listed first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

6. Listed all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

7. Listed all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. Listed the frequency count of employee last names (i.e., how many employees share each last name) in descending order.
